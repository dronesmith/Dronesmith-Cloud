# Forge Core

#Technologies
Forge is entirely MEAN stack, and as such is powered by the following technologies:

- Nodejs
- Express
- MongoDB
- AngularJS

In addition, it also uses the following:

- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- LESS
- Mongoose
- Redis
- PassportJS
- Angular UI

3D.js, TQuery, ace-ui, some others will no doubtedly be supported in the future.

# Architecture

Forge is architected as a ODM-driven Route-oriented Model-Controller with two-way binding views compiled client side. The following is an explanation of each layer:

### View Layer  
The view layer is standard HTML/CSS/Javascript. Behavior is bounded both ways, so changes in the Client Control layer will update this layer and vice-versa, via Angular's `$scope` injection. 

Bootstrap is used for basic templating, and Forge comes with its own bootstrap theme that is compiled whenever there is a change to it via a middlware. You can make adjustments to it in the `theme/css` directory. Everything in this directory is compiled with LESS, so if you want to define your own LESS stylesheets, define them in here as well.

Standard CSS should be defined in the `public/css` directory. You probably don't need to make any new files, here are the currently existing files:

**style.css** - All styling outside of bootstrap theme. Every new template has an id associate with it. **All styles must have #idname preceeding them for that corresponding template!** Further more, please follow the comments for grouping conventions. 

**animations.css** - Defines animations. Any animations should be grouped with the same conventions above.

**bootstrap.css** - This is an autogenerated file. Modify the less stuff if you want to change the bootstrap theme.

### Client Control Layer 

Talk about angular controllers/directives/filters/etc here

### Routing Layer 

Talk about node express here. RESTful stuff.

### Server Control Layer

Talk about serverside of Forge.

### DB Layer

Talk about ODM, Redis and Mongo, and schema layout

# Running

	npm install
	grunt serve
	
Optionally, you can directly invoke the app with the following:

	node app.js
	
Runtime configuration settings can be edited in the `properties.json` file. In addition, `properies.[environment].json` allows you to create multiple configs per environment (for example, `properties.development.json`).

For development environemnts, to view your app, navigate to `localhost:3000` by default. 

For everything to work right, you will need to have the mongo daemon (`mongod`) and redis (`redis-server`) running, along with nodejs installed.
